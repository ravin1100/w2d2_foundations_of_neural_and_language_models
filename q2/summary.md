# Hallucination Detection Summary

## Statistics

- Total questions: 15
- In-KB questions: 10
- Out-of-domain questions: 5
- First attempt correct: 10
- Correct after retry: 0
- Answers differing from KB: 0

## Analysis

The validation system uses simple string matching to detect hallucinations. It checks if the model's answer matches what's in our knowledge base and flags any discrepancies as potential hallucinations.

### Strengths

- Simple to implement
- Clear distinction between in-KB and out-of-domain questions
- Retry mechanism helps catch and correct hallucinations

### Limitations

- String matching is brittle and may flag correct answers with different wording
- Cannot validate the accuracy of out-of-domain answers
- No semantic understanding of answers

### Improvements

- Implement semantic matching instead of string matching
- Add confidence scores to model responses
- Expand the knowledge base with reliable sources
- Implement more sophisticated retry strategies
